# Facebook Clone (Mini Version)

This is a **mini Facebook clone** where I've mimicked 2-3 basic pages like:

- `index` (landing page)
- `signup`
- `login/password`
- `cancel`

> **Disclaimer**: This is **not a full Facebook clone**. This project is just a **beginner attempt** to understand and implement Tailwind CSS.

## Why I Built This

I'm currently learning **Tailwind CSS**, and this is my **first ever project** using it! I wanted to get a feel of how real-world websites like Facebook structure their pages, and how I can try to rebuild similar layouts using only Tailwind.

## Pages Implemented

- **Index Page** - Mimics the login landing of Facebook
- **Sign Up Page** - Layout of a registration form
- **Login/Password Page** - A basic password input page
- **Cancel Page** - Just a small experimental page I added for learning

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (no custom CSS used)
- No JavaScript functionality (yet!) – purely frontend and static

## What I Learned

- Basic Tailwind utilities and responsive classes
- How to mimic real-world UI using Tailwind
- Importance of spacing, alignment, and design consistency
